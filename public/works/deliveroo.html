              For two years, I lead design on the Rider Core team, where we focused primarily on the delivery experience. This includes getting riders to restaurants and customers as efficiently as possible, helping them to resolve common delivery issues without calling support, and empowering them with as much information as possible while taking steps to counteract abuse.

        Deliveroo operates in 12 different countries, from the United Kingdom to the United Arab Emirates, covering major cities across Europe, Asia, and Australia. Each market is completely different from the next, offering unique cityscapes, rider demographics, employment laws, and environmental conditions. Designing a single product that could accomodate a vast range of users and scenarios was a constant, rewarding challenge.

                                In the UK, most of Deliveroo's riders are immigrants, reliant on the income to provide for families; in Italy they are university students living with their parents. In UAE a large chunk of riders are illiterate, most transactions are done in cash, and wide roads and hostile temperatures mean motorbikes are the only possible vehicle; in Hong Kong, most deliveries are done by foot, with riders spending more time in elevators than on the ground. </p>

                      The home screen is the first thing riders see when they open their app. It’s where they begin and end their sessions, wait for orders, browse zones, and understand demand — the jumping-off point for every aspect of their work. Yet while we had redesigned just about every part of the app, the home screen was the one thing that had gone unchanged since 2016.</p>

                      <p class="f5 f5-ns mv0 w-100 lh-copy mb5 light indent pb1">
                      We found there was a huge opportunity here to not just gain parity with competitors, but to build a scalable framework for how we present relevant information to riders, provide better insights into areas and activity, and encourage fluid movement between delivery zones to accomodate shifting demand.</p>
                      <p class="f5 f5-ns mv0 w-100 lh-copy mb5 light indent pb1">While the the idea was initially dismissed for not being directly tied to quarterly metrics, was able to rouse excitement and gain support from stakeholders to prioritize the project by building a prototype framed concretely around company goals.

                    <li><b>Be systematic</b> — since the home screen should contain a mix of information of earnings, sessions, comms, etc, it needs to be designed in a way that lets every product team to build on it in a consistent fashion. </li>
