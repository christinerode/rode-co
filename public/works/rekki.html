            REKKI is an app for chefs to order directly from their suppliers. Our mission is to help independent restaurants stay sustainable by making it easier to manage food costs, stock, and orders.</h3>
      
      <p class="cl f5 w-90 lh-copy pv4 light">
        Founded by restauranteurs determined to make the work of back-of-house restaurant staff easier, REKKI focuses on a userbase that's received little attention from tech. While much of society has moved from phone calls to email and messaging for most comunication, the restaurant industry is still run over the phone: the typical restaurant still orders the next day's ingredients over voice mails every night, a process that is prone to mistakes and misunderstandings.

              REKKI functions as a chat app between restaurants and suppliers, letting chefs place and manage orders quickly and easily, allowing managers to keep an eye on orders from anywhere, and making sure suppliers can receive orders in a standardised format, compatible with their own systems.
          </p>

          <p class="f5 f5-ns mv0 w-100 lh-copy mb5 light pb1 indent ">
              We're currently focused on building a marketplace, making it easy for restaurants to search for products and find new suppliers. At the moment, if you're a chef creating a new menu, and you realize none of your existing suppliers offer oysters, you are most likely to go ask friends and other people in the industry for recommendations — there is no easy way to search. 
          </p>

          <p class="f5 f5-ns mv0 w-100 lh-copy mb5 light pb1 indent ">
              REKKI is uniquely positioned to be able to help. With thousands of restaurants placing their orders thorugh our platform daily, we have a rich dataset with which we can both help restaurants discover new suppliers that meet their needs or sell certain products, and drive business to suppliers that help them fill in their delivery routes and reach customers they wouldn't have otherwise. 
          </p>

          <p class="f5 f5-ns mv0 w-100 lh-copy mb5 pb1 indent ">
              This project is currently a work in progress, set to ship at the end of Q4 2019.
